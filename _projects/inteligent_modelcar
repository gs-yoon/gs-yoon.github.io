# Intelligent Model Car competition
<hr width="100%" color="black" size="5">

The goal of the competition is to design autonomous model car that traces correct lines and avoid obstacles. 

I designed object detection with image processing and steering controller with the Stanely method. There are two key points of my algorithms. 
First, I had to make my own filter for line scan image. It was not able to detect with well-known filters because of extreme noise and the very low disparity between lines and not lines. So, I made a filtering model that catches features of the line as the following formula.

**α** means start pixel to apply filter.<br>
**β** means end pixel to apply filter.

The second point is to adapt the Stanely method for steering. The formula that I used is expressed in below.

**δ** is angle to steer.<br>
**Ψ** is angle between direction of movement and tangent line of lane.<br>
**L** is distance between car and lane.

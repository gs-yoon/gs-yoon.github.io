This section describe my projects befor graduate. 
All of the projects are not related to school lecture.

## Intelligent Model Car competition
<hr width="100%" color="black" size="5">

Goal of the competition is to design autonomous model car that trace correct lines and avoid obstacles. 
I desinged object detection with image processing and steer controller with stanely method


# Indoor Guide Robot for Visually Impaired Person
<hr width="100%" color="black" size="5">

Using ROS, I implemented a indoor guide robot application into mobile robot. 
  It was designed for blind person to visit huge building that has several floors.
  A very short paper was submitted in The 15th Korea Robotics Society Annual Conference (KRoC 2020)


# In-Memory Computing SRAM with Xnor CNN
<hr width="100%" color="black" size="5">

I developed a system accelerate CNN. It was organized with computable SRAM and optimized xnor-network CNN.  


# Learning Based Kalman Filter
<hr width="100%" color="black" size="5">

To automatically determine parmeters of the Kalman filter Using machine learning and convex optimization. In other words, learing the parameters of kalmanfiter

Kalman filtering problem of a dynamic system can be expressed as convex optimization form like below.

Goal is obtain proper value of **Ï„** and **Q** using machine learning

 
**Result animation** (blue = Groundtruth, orange = estimated position of robot)

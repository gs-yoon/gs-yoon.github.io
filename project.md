Goal of the competition is to design autonomous model car that trace correct lines and avoid obstacles. 
I desinged object detection with image processing and steer controller with stanely method

# Indoor Guide Robot for Visually Impaired Person
<hr width="100%" color="black" size="5">

Using ROS, I implemented a indoor guide robot application into mobile robot. 
  It was designed for blind person to visit huge building that has several floors 
  A very short paper was submitted in The 15th Korea Robotics Society Annual Conference (KRoC 2020)

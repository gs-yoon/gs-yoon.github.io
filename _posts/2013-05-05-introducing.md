### Research Interests : Image Understanding and Visual Odometry.
　Especially in image understanding, I’m interested in wavelet transform. Using wavelet transform for deep learning would make possible immediate image understanding. So, it must be very useful in an autonomous environment. If apply compressed sensing to this, it can be faster. <br>
　For visual odometry, I hope to apply convex optimization. Many parameters of visual odometry (e.g. coefficients of lens distortion or many filters...) must be adopted very correctly. Using convex optimization and machine learning, it will be possible to obtain value properly and easily.

### Research Interests : Convex Optimization, Image Understanding&Copressive Sensing.
　With convex optimization, I think many problem of determin acurate parameters or coeffecients can be slolved. For example, parameter of Kalman Filter or coefficeints of sensor calibration shoudle be determined practically. So, It would be possible for the problem to be sloved automaticaly with convex optimization. <br>
　Especially in image understanding, I’m interested in compressed sensing and wavelet transform. Using compressed sensing and wavlete for deep learning would make possible immediate image understanding. So, it must be very useful in real time system like autonomous environment.

#### Projects

<p class="smallText"><b>Intelligent Model Car competition</b></p>
  <div class="message">
  <p class="smallText">
    The goal is to design autonomous model car.
  First, I made some image filtering and lane detecting algorithms for lane detection.
  The agorithms is consist of emphasizing features and finding minimum/maximum points to determine lane.
  Second, I made a control algorithm using Stanely Method for lane tracking.
  I received a prize for successful accomplishment.

<p class="smallText"><b>Indoor Guide Robot for Visually Impaired Person</b></p>
  <div class="message">
  <p class="smallText">I implemented a indoor guidance s/w for mobile robot using ROS. 
  It was designed for blind person to visit huge building that has several floors. 
  I presented it in The 15th Korea Robotics Society Annual Conference (KRoC 2020).
  I received a prize for successful accomplishment. </p>

<p class="smallText"><b>In-Memory Computing SRAM with Xnor CNN</b></p>
  <div class="message">
  <p class="smallText">
    I desinged Processing In Memory(PIM) for accelerating CNN.
    First, I desinged PIM with dual-split SRAM.
    Second, I desinged XNOR-CNN to calculate in PIM.
    The XNOR-CNN has quantized CNN architecture(1 or -1) to use xnor operation.</p>

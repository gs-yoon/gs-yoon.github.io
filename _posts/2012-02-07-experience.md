### Intelligent Model Car competition
  Goal of the competition is to design autonomous model car that trace correct lines and avoid obstacles. 
  I desinged object detection with image processing and steer controller with stanely method.
  Moreover, I made almost H/W Platform of it.
  
### Indoor Guide Robot for Visually Impaired Person
  Using ROS, I implemented a indoor guidance application for mobile robot. 
  It was designed for blind person to visit huge building that has several floors. 
  A very short paper was submitted in The 15th Korea Robotics Society Annual Conference (KRoC 2020)

### In-Memory Computing SRAM with Xnor CNN
  I developed a system accelerating CNN. It was comprised of computable SRAM and optimized xnor-network CNN.  

### Learning Based Kalman Filter
  To automatically determine parmeters of the Kalman filter with machine learning and convex optimization. In other words, learing the parameters of kalmanfiter

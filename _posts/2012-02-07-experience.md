### Intelligent Model Car competition
  Goal of the competition is to design autonomous model car that trace correct lanes and avoid obstacles. 
  Our team desinged Lane Detection with image processing and steer controller with Stanely Method.
  My first role is Developing System with Infineon MCUs and many H/W Parts. Second role is Lane Detection.
  For detecting lanes, I implemented many filters and feature extraction.
  
  
### Indoor Guide Robot for Visually Impaired Person
  Using ROS, I implemented a indoor guidance application for mobile robot. 
  It was designed for blind person to visit huge building that has several floors. 
  A very short paper was submitted in The 15th Korea Robotics Society Annual Conference (KRoC 2020)

### In-Memory Computing SRAM with Xnor CNN
  I developed CNN acceleration system. It was comprised of computable SRAM and optimized XNOR-CNN.  

### Learning Based Kalman Filter
  For automatically determining parmeters of the Kalman filter with machine learning and convex optimization.

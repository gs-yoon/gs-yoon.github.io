### Intelligent Model Car competition
  Goal of the competition is to design autonomous model car that trace correct lines and avoid obstacles. 
  I desinged object detection with image processing and steer controller with stanely method

### Indoor Guide Robot for Visually Impaired Person
  Using ROS, I implemented a indoor guide robot application into mobile robot. 
  It was designed for blind person to visit huge building that has several floors 
  A very short paper was submitted in The 15th Korea Robotics Society Annual Conference (KRoC 2020)

### In-Memory Computing SRAM with Xnor CNN
  I developed a system accelerate CNN. It was organized with computable SRAM and optimized xnor-network CNN.  

### Learning Based Kalman Filter
  To automatically determine parmeters of the Kalman filter Using machine learning and convex optimization. In other words, learing the parameters of kalmanfiter
